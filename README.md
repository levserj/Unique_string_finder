# Unique_string_finder
This util takes a String as an argument and searches for the substring, containing all of the unique symbols of the initial String.
To find unique symbols, algorithm takes advantage of the HashSet’s “no duplicates” property, and to find substring it goes in loop through every substring of corresponding length and compares them to the content of the set with unique symbols.
